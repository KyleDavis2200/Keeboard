# Keyboard

In this project, I am seeking to make a custom mechanical keyboard using a Raspberry Pi Pico clone. The main feature that makes this unique is the connectors on either side of the board that allow it to be connected to external modules. I plan to make a wireless macropad / numberpad in a future project, that can be connected to either side of the keyboard to charge. These connectors will also include IÂ²C communication, which should give me the option of adding more features, such as a screen, in the future.
