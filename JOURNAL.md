I began this project by first researching how keyboard PCBs were laid out, as I knew that would be the main challenge in this project. I came across [a video series by Joe Scotto](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBD2IS_t_iWZDMdG_ZF57x9Ebm3kxKqxF) that helped me understand exactly how everything would be laid out. These tutorials guided me towards keyboard-layout-editor.com, where I layed out a standard TKL layout for this keyboard.

Following the instructions in these tutorials, I then began to plan out how I would layout the columns and rows for this keyboard.

Using the previous drawing of the rows and columns for the key matrix, I began making a schematic in KiCad of the keyboard, using symbols from [Joe Scotto's library](https://github.com/joe-scotto/scottokeebs).

I then moved onto selecting exactly which switches and keycaps I would use. I opted for Princess Tactile switches and 8008 keycaps. I also selected the cable and stabilizers I would be using for this build at this time.
