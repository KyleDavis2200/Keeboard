I began this project by first researching how keyboard PCBs were laid out, as I knew that would be the main challenge in this project. I came across [a video series by Joe Scotto](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBD2IS_t_iWZDMdG_ZF57x9Ebm3kxKqxF) that helped me understand exactly how everything would be laid out. These tutorials guided me towards keyboard-layout-editor.com, where I layed out a standard TKL layout for this keyboard.

Using these tutorials, I then began to plan out how I would layout the columns and rows for this keyboard.
